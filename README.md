Training ResNet-34 on the CIFAR-10 dataset and plotted the number of steps and the SFO complexities of SGD using Armijo/Constant condition needed for the test accuracy to be more than 0.90. Please see [number of steps](./CIFAR10_test_K-b.png) and [number of SFO](./CIFAR10_test_Kb-b.png) for details.
